    "## Why?\n",
    "As PhD Calvin, I felt I had to get into my role and crank out a simulation. After all, we know that all theoretical physicists really do is mess around in simulations ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does it do? \n",
    "This simulation simulates Calvin having fun at the bachelor party. There is a large bank of fun things that will randomly happen to him during the party with his bachelors. Each event will last for a certain number of time in the party and could involve Calvin taking 1 (or more!) drinks. The simulation will calculate Calvin's BAC over the course of the party and display it after each event occurs so we can track his \"progress\". The simulation ends once the length of the party in hours has been reached. Hope you enjoy!\n",
